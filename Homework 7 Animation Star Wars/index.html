            nicely" and is not afraid of calculations on the user side. But he comes not alone, having 3 of his faithful

        <p class="text">It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory
            against the evil Galactic Empire.</p>

            an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.</p>
