    <h2>Represent your life with a simple photo</h2>
    <p> Every day is a gift and every gift is beautiful in its own way. Sometimes the gifts are not directly received or
        given from one person to another, but they are simply all around us. They wait for us to notice and appreciate
        them. By doing so, we give ourselves the greatest gift of all — the gift of being present and being open to the
        wonderful world that surrounds us. </p>
    <p> We are often reminded that the little things are the ones that really matter in life, yet we are prone to be
        distracted by the pursuit of big milestones in our busy lives. Little things, in this case, can also apply to
        everyday things. The beautiful tree that give us a cool shade on a warm day. The sun, which occasionally shines
        through the clouds to lift our spirits. A cool sea breeze, whose saltiness and depth reminds us of the vastness
        of the ocean. A park bench, which gives us the opportunity to relax and unwind in our own thoughts and musings.
        There are far more “little things” in life than grandiose occurrences. Live in these moments that exist between
        the big events, and they will define you as much as the larger occasions that we remember.</p>
